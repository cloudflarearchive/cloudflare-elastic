### Use Elasticsearch and Kibana to visualize Cloudflare logs

# AWS Lambda Function for Forwarding Cloudflare Logs to Elasticsearch

This lambda function will collect Cloudflare logs from an S3 bucket and forward them to an Elasticsearch cluster running on **[Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co)**.

The official documentation can be found on [Cloudflare's](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/analytics-integrations/elastic/) site 

### Build
**```./gradlew clean build```**


### Install

Upload build/distributions/cloudflare-elastic-aws.zip to AWS. Due to the size of the distribution, you may need to upload the file to an S3 bucket before configuring.


### Configure

##### Configure handler method

com.cloudflare.elastic.ElasticLambdaForwarder::handleRequest
com.cloudflare.elastic.ElasticLambdaSNSForwarder::handleRequest

##### Configure environment variables

Certain environment variables must be configured so that the function can connect to the Elasticsearch cluster.

| Environment Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| elastic_hostname | Fully qualified domain name of the Elasticsearch endpoint |
| elastic_username | The username of the Elasticsearch user, e.g. elastic |
| elastic_password | The password of the Elasticsearch user |

Additionally, the following environment variables can optionally be configured.

| Environment Variable | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| elastic_port | Endpoint port number | 9243 |
| elastic_index | The index pattern to use | cloudflare-* |
| elastic_pipeline | The ingest pipeline to use for pre-processing (**cloudflare-pipeline-(weekly, daily)**) | cloudflare-pipeline-weekly |
| elastic_use_https | Whether to use SSL/TLS to connect | true |
| elastic_bulk_actions | Number of log messages to send to Elasticsearch per batch; can be tuned for scale and speed | 100 |
| elastic_bulk_concurrency | Number of concurrent requests to Elasticsearch; can be tuned for scale and speed | 2 |
| elastic_debug | Enable verbose logging | false |
| aws_access_key | Can be used to override permissions from execution role; typically not needed |  |
| aws_secret_key | Can be used to override permissions from execution role; typically not needed |  |


### Install Additional Artifacts

Change to the *conf* directory and issue the following command. 
```
./install-artifacts.sh -u elastic -p <RANDOM PASSWORD> -e https://_<YOUR DEPLOYMENT ENDPOINT>_:9243
```

This will install the ingest node processor and index templates.
